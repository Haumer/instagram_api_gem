# InstagramApi

A Ruby wrapper for the Instagram API. 
You can see the api endpoints here https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/

## Installation

```ruby
gem install instagram_api_client
```

## Usage

Before you start making the requests to instagram API provide the `access_token` using the configuration
wrapping.

```ruby
InstagramAPI.config do |config|
  config.access_token = 'put_your_token_here'
end
```

As for now Instagram access token doesn't change or expire, so you can use this simple-to-use service
to generate it http://services.chrisriversdesign.com/instagram-token/
I the nearest future the OAuth authorization for access token fetching will be implemented.

## TODOS

1. OAuth authorization for access token fetching
2. Incode Documentation
3. Cover functionality with tests
